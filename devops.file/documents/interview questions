Basic Questions
What is Playwright, and how is it different from Selenium?
  Playwright is a modern, open-source automation framework developed by Microsoft for testing web applications. It enables developers to perform end-to-end testing by automating browsers 
  such as Chromium (Chrome), Firefox, WebKit (Safari), and Microsoft Edge. Playwright supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET.

  playwright have inbuilt wait machinism , and its allow you to perform cross browser testing using , webkit,Firefox and chromium. and playwright have default report genrator, simplified parllel
  execution using browser context, execution speed Faster due to direct communication with browser engines.
   
How does Playwright handle cross-browser testing?
  By default playwright will allow cross browser testing by using (chromium,webkit,Firefox), however if you want to run in all the browser in single we can configure that in playwright.config.ts file

  (const browsersetup of [chromium,Firefox,webkit]){
    const browser = await browsersetup.launch()
    const browsercontext = await browser.newcontext()
    const page = await     browserContext.newPage()
    await page.goto("url")

  }

  by using playwright testrunner makes easier to run tests across multiple browser manually
